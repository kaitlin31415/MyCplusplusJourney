Description of Work: Created a class called Gradebook with a getter and setter for a courseName Variable
Comments: C++ is very similar to Java except in the syntax, I have to figure out what the const keyword does
          but once I can figure out how to do constructors and initialize variables in there with the getters
          and setters my life should be a bit easier
